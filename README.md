# Predictor for the Eurovision victory, from the twitter data

This repository contains the main code used to predict Eurovision winner, based on the number of tweets that occur during the semi-finals. The main blog post is here: http://astrodataiscool.com/2019/05/predicting-eurovision-2019-from-twitter-data-draft/

Unfortunately the code is not very well documented, and certainly not in ``plug and go'' state. I still hope that it might be useful to someone to see the function used, the logic and similar.
